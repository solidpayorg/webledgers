    <i><b>A ledger of URIs for the web</b></i>.
    <p>
      Web Ledgers is a way to create a ledger using URIs as keys on the web.

      <p>
        Web Ledgers are a new type of ledger for payments across the web. These new ledgers are
        designed to enable balances to be stored from many different platforms, and acts as a glue between eco systms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document specifies a format, interoperability guide lines, and operations that Web ledgers may support.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>One time codes are a popular way of solving one off problems on the web. And example might be sending someone a
      code
      to log in to a system, or one to reset a password or one to creating a private address for a calendar. However
      there
      exists no generic URN on the web to encode such a one time code such that it can be used for redeeming a payment,
      good or service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document specifies a format, and operations that Web Ledgers may support.

        Design Goals
      </h2>

      <p>
        Web Ledgers are a component of larger systems, such as
        the Linked Data ecosystem [[LINKED-DATA]], which have driven
        the design goals for this specification. This section summarizes the
        primary design goals for this specification.
