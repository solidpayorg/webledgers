    <i><b>A mapping of URIs to balances for the web</b></i>.
    <p>
      Web Ledgers are a way to map URIs to balances, <i>within a given context</i>, on the web.

      <p>
        Web Ledgers are a new type of ledger for the web. These new ledgers are
        designed to enable balances to be stored from many different contexts, and acts as a glue between ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document specifies a format, interoperability guide lines, and operations that Web ledgers may support.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>A ledger in its simplest sense consists of two columns. The first column is an agent, the second column is a
      balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document specifies a format, and operations that Web Ledgers may support. This spec is a work in progress.

      <p>
        Web Ledgers are a component of larger systems, such as
        the Linked Data ecosystem [[LINKED-DATA]], which have driven
        the design goals for this specification. This section summarizes the
        primary design goals for this specification.

    <h3>Terminology</h3>



    <dl class="termlist">
      <dt><dfn lt="agent|agent">agent</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        An Agent is a URI that denotes a person, machine or account on the web.
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn lt="balance|balance">balance</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        Each URI maps to a balance in the Web Ledger. A balance is a numerical value with an explicit or implicit
        unit of currency. If not unit is stated the unit MAY be taken from the popular electronic coin, bitcoin, and
        is
        equal to 1 satoshi.
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn lt="currency|currency">currency</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        A currency is denomination of a given balance
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn lt="decentralized system|decentralized systems">decentralized system</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        A system in which lower level components operate on local information to
        accomplish global goals. For example, an ant colony is a decentralized system
        as there is no central control determining when food must be collected or
        how new tunnels should be excavated.
